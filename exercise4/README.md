## Bighorn Sheep Dominance Node-link Visualization using NetworkX

### Motivation
-------------------
In order to understand and interpret the dominance relationships between females bighorns and their behaviors, 
visualization of node-link network graphs was created, attributes such as ages and observed dominance during a 
fight were considered and integrated in visualization.

### Data
-------------------
Bighorn sheep dominance http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html#sheep

### Task
-------------------
Given the sheep datasets, this report aims at interpreting followings via node-link visualization using networkX:
1. Which bighorn sheep dominates the most during fights?
2. How is age attribute related to these dominance relationships?

From visualization prospective, following actions will be taking:
- EDA on nodes and edges(non-visualization)
- Explain the deficiency of raw node-link visualization in networkX with 4 layouts
- Explain the effectiveness and expressiveness of improved node-link visualization 
  - Edge width(indicated by normalized weights)
  - Circle size(indicated by degree of centrality or weighted degree of centrality)
  - Circle color(indicated by age groups)
  - Miscellaneous(color map, font size, layouts)


### Visualization
-------------------
#### Raw node-link networkx graph:

Deficiency of Fig. 1 implementation:
- Sheep nodes were overlapped in certain layouts(default and random layout).
- Very limited information was represented and conveyed because the capability of differentiation for each graph 
element(circle size, line width,  color map) is restricted.

#### Improved node-link networkx graph:

Fig. 2 displays two sets of selected layouts: shell and kamada kawai. Under each set, two strategies of weights were applied to indicate a node size. 
- Strategy 1: degree of centrality, count the number of dominance that a node has  
- Strategy 2: Sum of total weights for a node then divided by degree of centrality

In Fig.2, sheep nodes were also represented in circles with different colors, which indicates the sheep nodeâ€™s age groups. The width of the edge represents the total occurrence of observed dominance(normalized weights) between two sheeps, the arrow indicates a dominating relationship during a fight.
When comparing the two graphs in the same layout, it renders distinct dominance results, in kamada kawai layout, top 3 nodes with the most degree of centrality are the sheeps dominates fights most(sheep 22, 8, 3), however, when degree of centrality was divided by total observed occurrences, top 3 nodes are 21, 24, 8, meaning even a sheep may fight with less different sheep but the number of fights between this sheep with same opponent may occurred many times.

Meanwhile, ages are positively correlated to the results of fights, older sheep(red-ish circles) tend to have more dominating relationships, which also has been observed more, since there are more thicker edges between an older sheep and other sheep.


### Conclusion
-------------------
To conclude, in terms of which bighorn sheep dominates the most. It depends, the sheep that wins the fights with the most number of different sheep could be the one that dominates the most, also the sheep that wins fights with less number of sheep could also be the one that dominates the most because the fight between the same opponents may occur a significant number of times.
Age attribute can be a strong indicator of dominance relationships, more specifically, an old sheep tends to dominate more fights or has been observed more when dominating a fight with the same opponent.

From a visualization perspective, improved node-link graphs convey more effectively and expressively than the raw implementation by integrating the information to node size, node color, edge width.
